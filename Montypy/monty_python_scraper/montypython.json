Well obviously it'll depend how far you've got your party when the signal for Red Revolt is raised. If you're just having preliminary aperitifs - Dubonnet, a sherry or a sparkling white wine - then the guests will obviously be in a fairly formal mood and it will be difficult to tell which are the communist agitators. So the thing to do is to get some cloth and some bits of old paper, put it down on the floor and shoot everybody. This will deal with the Red Menace on your own doorstep. If you're having canapés, as I showed you last week, or an outdoor barbecue, then the thing to do is to set fire to all houses in the street. This will stir up anti-communist hatred and your neighbours will be right with you as you organize counter-revolutionary terror.

This time one of the pantomime horses concedes defeat and so lives to fight another day. Here, in a colony of sea lions, we see a huge bull sea lion seeing off an intruding bull who is attempting to intrude on his harem. This pattern of aggressive behaviour is typical of these documentaries. Here we see two limpets locked in a life or death struggle for territory. The huge bull limpet, enraged by the rock, endeavours to encircle its sprightly opponent. Here we see an ant. This ant is engaged in a life or death struggle with the wolf. You can see the ant creeping up on the wolf on all sixes. Now he stops to observe. Satisfied that the wolf has not heard him, he approaches nearer. With great skill he chooses his moment and then, quick as a limpet, with one mighty bound buries his fangs in the wolf's neck. The wolf struggles to no avail. A battle of this kind can take anything up to fifteen years because the timber ant has such a tiny mouth. Here we see Heinz Sielmann engaged in a life or death struggle with Peter Scott. They are engaged in a bitter punch-up over repeat fees on the overseas sales of their nature documentaries. Now they have been joined by an enraged Jacques Cousteau. This is typical of the harsh and bitchy world of television features. Here we see a honey bear not engaged in a life or death struggle about anything. These honey bears are placid and peaceful creatures and consequently bad television. Here we see a pantomime horse. It is engaged in a life or death struggle for a job with a merchant bank. However, his rival employee, the huge bull pantomime horse, is lying in wait for him. Poor pantomime horse. Here we see a pantomime goose engaged in a life or death struggle with Terence Rattigan. The enraged goose fires. Poor Terence. Another victim of this silly film. Here we see an enraged pantomime Princess Margaret, she is lying in wait for her breakfast. The unsuspecting breakfast glides ever closer to its doom. The enraged pantomime royal person is poised for the kill. She raises her harpoon and fires. Pang! Right in the toast. A brief struggle and all is over. Poor breakfast!

Some of it in nice piles, others in lovely clanky bits of loose change, some of it neatly counted into fat little hundreds, delicate fivers stuffed into bulging wallets, nice crisp clean cheques, pert pieces of copper coinage thrust deep into trouser pockets, romantic foreign money rolling against the thigh with rough familiarity, beautiful wayward curlicued banknotes, filigree copperplating cheek by jowl with tumbling hexagonal milled edges, rubbing gently against the terse leather of beautifully balanced bank books I'm sorry. But I love money. All money. I've always wanted money. To handle. To touch. The smell of the rain-washed florin. The lure of the lira. The glitter and the glory of the guinea.

Right, Slit Eyes Yakomoto, I'm arresting you for the impersonation of Signor Luchino Visconti, famous Italian director of such movie classics as 'Ossessione' 1942, 'La Tetra Trema' 1948, and 'Bellissima' 1951 - a satisfying ironic slice-of-life drama. 1957 brought to the silver screen his 'I Bianche Notre' adapted by Dostoyevsky, a mannered and romantic melancholy of snow and mist and moonlit encounters on canal bridges. 'Boccaccio 70' followed five years later and the following year saw 'The Leopard'! So impressed was I with this motion picture treatment of the Risorgimento that I went along to Somerset House and changed me own name to Leopard, preferring it to me original handle, 'Panther' (Aargh). I digress. 1969 saw 'The Damned', a Götterdämmerung epic of political and industrial shennanigans in good old Nazi Germany, starring Helmut Berger as a stinking transvestite what should have his face sawn off, the curvaceous Charlotte Rampling as a bit of tail, and the impeccable Dirk Bogarde as Von Essen.

Starting only with a theory, Mr Norris set out to prove that the inhabitants of Hounslow could have been descendants of the people of Surbiton who had made the great trek north. No newcomer to this field, Mr Norris's 'A Short History of Motor Traffic Between Purley and Esher' had become a best-selling minor classic in the car-swapping belt.

Early on they began to perceive encouraging signs. The writing on the sign was almost exactly the same as the writing in the AA book. They were on the right route. During the long hours of the voyage, Mr Norris's wife Betty kept a complete photographic record and made sandwiches. This is some of the unique footage which Mrs Norris got back from the chemists... Mile succeeded mile and the terrific strain was beginning to tell when suddenly, by an amazing stroke of luck, Mr Norris had come across the Kingston by-pass. This was something to tell the Round Table. At this stage, Mr Norris was faced with two major divergent theories concerning his Surbiton ancestors. Did they take the Kingston by-pass, turning left at Barnes, or did they strike west up the A308 via Norbiton to Hampton Wick? Both these theories ran up against one big obstacle - the Thames, lying like a silver turd between Richmond and Isleworth. This was a major setback. How could they possibly cross the river? Several hours of thought produced nothing. There was only one flask of coffee left when suddenly Mr Norris spotted something. Could this have been the method used? Hardly daring to believe, Mr Norris led his expedition on to the 3.47. Forty minutes later, via Clapham, Fulham, Chiswick and Brentford, they approached their goal: Hounslow. Was this, then, the final proof? Something aroused the accountant's instinct buried deep in Mr Norris's make-up. The journey was possible, and yet .... 'Wrong Way' Norris had accidentally stumbled on a piece of anthropological history. It was the inhabitants of Hounslow who had made the great trek south to the sunnier pastures of Surbiton, and not vice versa, as he had originally surmised. This was the secret of Surbiton!

If La Fontaine's elk would spurn Tom Jones the engine must be our head, the dining car our oesophagus, the guard's van our left lung, the cattle truck our shins, the first-class compartment the piece of skin at the nape of the neck and the level crossing an electric elk called Simon.

The train is the same only the time is altered. Ecce homo, ergo elk. La Fontaine knew his sister and knew her bloody well. The point is taken, the beast is moulting, the fluff gets up your nose. The illusion is complete; it is reality, the reality is illusion and the ambiguity is the only truth. But is the truth, as Hitchcock observes, in the box?

SUPERIMPOSED FLASHING CAPTION: 'STOP THE FILM' Presenter The rules are very simple. We have taken a film which contains compromising scenes and unpleasant details, which could wreck a man's career. But, the victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But remember the money increases as the film goes on. So the longer you leave it...the more you have to pay! So now, with the clock at £300 this week 'Stop the Film' visited Thames Ditton... Presenter He's being very brave here... Presenter Hello, sir, hello, yes. No sir, no, I'm sure you didn't. No, it's all right, sir, we don't morally censure, we just want the money....Yes, and here's the address to send it to: Voice Over 'BLACKMAIL BEHIND THE HOT WATER PIPES THIRD WASHROOM ALONG VICTORIA STATION' Presenter Not at all, sir...thank . Man Sorry chaps, it was my mother. Toastmaster Gentlemen, pray silence for the President of the Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things. Sir William I thank you, gentlemen. The year has been a good one for the Society . This year our members have put more things on top of other things than ever before. But, I should warn you, this is no time for complacency. No, there are still many things, and I cannot emphasize this too strongly, on top of other things. I myself, on my way here this evening, saw a thing that was not on top of another thing in any way. Shame indeed but we must not allow ourselves to become too despondent. For, we must never forget that if there was not one thing that was not on top of another thing our society would be nothing more than a meaningless body of men that had gathered together for no good purpose. But we flourish. This year our Australasian members and the various organizations affiliated to our Australasian branches put no fewer than twenty-two things on top of other things. Well done all of you. But there is one cloud on the horizon. In this last year our Staffordshire branch has not succeeded in putting one thing on top of another . Therefore I call upon our Staffordshire delegate to explain this weird behaviour. Mr Cutler Er, Cutler, Staffordshire. Um ... well, Mr Chairman, it's just that most of the members in Staffordshire feel... the whole thing's a bit silly. Sir William Silly! SILLY!! Silly! I suppose it is, a bit. What have we been doing wasting our lives with all this nonsense? Right, okay, meeting adjourned for ever. Sir William Good Lord. I'm on film. How did that happen? Sir William It's film again. What's going on? Sir William Gentlemen! I have bad news. This room is surrounded by film. Members What? What? A Member We're trapped! Sir William Don't panic, we'll get out of this. A Member How? Sir William We'll tunnel our way out. Barnes Good thinking, sir. I'll get the horse. Sir William Okay Captain, you detail three men, start digging and load them up with cutlery, and then we'll have a rota, we'll have two hours digging, two hours vaulting and then two hours sleeping, okay? Mr Cutler All right, Medwin, let's see you get over that horse. Pick your feet up, Medwin. Come on, boy! First German Officer (Ian Davidson) Ze stupid English. Zey are prisoners and all they do is the sport. Second German Officer One thing worries me, Fritz. First German Officer Ja? Second German Officer Where's the traditional cheeky and lovable Cockney sergeant? Sergeant Cheer up, Fritz, it may never happen Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner... Second German Officer Good. Everything seems to be in order. Mr Cutler Colonel! I've just found another exit, sir. Sir William Okay, quickly, run this way. Everyone If we could run that way . .. sorry. ANIMATION: Animation Voice Oh, I'm terribly sorry, excuse me. Linkman Ah, hello. Well they certainly seem to be in a tight spot, and spot... our next item - so let's get straight on with the fun and go over to the next item - or dish! Ha, ha! Praline Hello. 'Ow are you? I'm fine. Welcome to a new half-hour chat show in which me, viz the man what's talking to you now, and Brooky - to wit my flat mate - and nothing else, I'd like to emphasize that - discuss current affairs issues of burning import. Brooky Have you heard the one about the three nuns in the nudist colony? Praline Shut up. Tonight, the population explosion. Brooky Apparently there were these three nuns... Praline Shut up. Come the year 1991, given the present rate of increase in the world's population, the Chinese will be three deep. Another thing... Floor Manager Sorry, loves, sorry, the show is too long this week and this scene's been cut. Praline Lord Hill's at the bottom of this. Floor Manager But if you can find a piano stool you can appear later on in the show on film. Brooky 'Ow much? Floor Manager Oh, about ten bob each? Praline I wouldn't wipe me nose on it. Brooky 'Ave you 'eard the one about these three nuns... Praline Shh. I can hear something. 'Ang about, we may still get in this show as a link. Brooky That's clever. How do they do that? Praline Colour separation, you cotton head. ANIMATION: Linkman Well, they seem to be in another tight spot... Could you...could you, could you keep it down a little, please. Thank you so much. Could you keep it down please...Thank you. Well and now we move on to our, to our main course. Prawn salad...Prawn salad? Butler Well, if you'll just wait in here, sir, I'm sure Mr Thompson won't keep you waiting long. Man Fine. Thanks very much. Man The mirror fell off the wall. Butler Sir? Man The mirror fell off... off the wall... it fell. Butler I see. You'd better wait here. I'll get a cloth. Man Ah, it ... it came off the wall. Butler Yes, sir? Man It just came right off the wall.

Your legs are so swollen. Sir William Excuse me, is that the school hall? Bishop Um, I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm not in this one - I'm in next week's, I think. Sir William Oh, come on. Bishop Oh, Mr Belpit!... Sir William Oh, here we are. Linkman Ah well, they seem to have linked that themselves, so there's no need for me to interrupt at all. So, ah, back to the school hall. Schoolmaster 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'. Headmaster 'Tis time the seven Smith brothers had brides. Fetch me Smith Major. First Smith Sir. Headmaster 'Tis time you and your six brothers were married. First Smith Thank you, Headmaster. Headmaster Fetch me your six brothers, that the seven brothers may be together. Boys Behold, the seven brothers. Headmaster Right, I'll see Watson, Wilkins, and Spratt in my study afterwards. First Smith But where shall we find seven brides for seven brothers? Second Smith The Sabine School for Girls. Third Smith Yes, and it's the Annual Dance. Headmaster Fetch hither the seven brides for seven brothers. Two Girls Behold the seven brides. Headmaster Fetch hither the padre that the seven brides may marry the seven brothers. Fetch hither the master on duty that the seven brides may marry the seven brothers. Padre Sorry, I'm late, Headmaster - I've been wrestling with Plato. Headmaster What you do in your own time, Padre, is written on the wall in the vestry. Padre Right, do you four boys take these two girls to be your seven brides? Boys Yes, sir. Padre Right, go and do your prep. Gent Good morning, I'd care to purchase a chicken, please. Butcher Don't come here with that posh talk you nasty, stuck-up twit. Gent I beg your pardon? Butcher A chicken, sir. Certainly. Gent Thank you. And how much does that work out to per pound, my good fellow? Butcher Per pound, you slimy trollop, what kind of a ponce are you? Gent I'm sorry? Butcher 4/6 a pound, sir, nice and ready for roasting. Gent I see, and I'd care to purchase some stuffing in addition, please. Butcher Use your own, you great poofy poonagger! Gent What? Butcher Ah, certainly sir, some stuffing. Gent Oh, thank you. Butcher 'Oh, thank you' says the great queen like a la-di-dah poofta. Gent I beg your pardon? Butcher That's all right, sir, call again. Gent Excuse me. Butcher What is it now, you great pillock? Gent Well, I can't help noticing that you insult me and then you're polite to me alternately. Butcher I'm terribly sorry to hear that, sir. Gent That's all right. It doesn't really matter. Butcher Tough titty if it did, you nasty spotted prancer. Linkman Sorry, I asked for tea. Thank you very much. Well we've had the dessert and then, and so the first item, the item on our menu of fun is the coffee. Now I did ask for tea. Waitress But you just said coffee. Linkman No, no, that was just my announcement, just a metaphor. Linkman We come...look would you mind keeping it down, please...we come as - as I said just now, to the coffee. Waitress Here, he said it again! Linkman Shut up! Voice Over This is Ken Clean-Air Systems, the great white hope of the British boxing world. After three fights - and only two convictions - his manager believes that Ken is now ready to face the giant American, Satellite Five. Manager The great thing about Ken is that he's almost totally stupid. Voice Over Every morning, he jogs the forty-seven miles from his two-bedroomed, eight-bathroom, six-up-two-down, three-to-go-house in Reigate, to the Government's Pesticide Research Centre at Shoreham. Nobody knows why. Mrs CAS Basically Ken is a very gentle, home-loving person. I remember when one of his stick insects had a knee infection. He stayed up all night rubbing it with germoline and banging its head on the table. Mother Oh he was such a pretty baby, always so kind and gentle. He was really considerate to his mother, and not at all the kind of person you'd expect to pulverize their opponent into a bloody mass of flesh and raw bone, spitting teeth and fragments of gum into a ring which had become one man's hell and Ken's glory. Voice Over Every morning at his little three-room semi near Reading, Ken gets up at three o'dock and goes back to bed again because it's far too early. Voice Over At seven o'clock Ken gets up, he has a quick shower, a rub-down, gets into his track-suit, and goes back to bed again. At 7.50 every morning Ken's trainer runs the 13,000 miles from his two-room lean-to in Bangkok and gets him up. Trainer I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar on the back of the head. But I recently found that this was too far from his brain and I wasn't getting through to him anymore. So I now wake him up with a steel peg driven into his skull with a mallet. Voice Over For breakfast every day, Ken places a plate of liver and bacon under his chair, and locks himself in the cupboard. Manager Well, he's having a lot of mental difficulties with his breakfasts, but this is temperament, caused by a small particle of brain in his skull, and once we've removed that he'll be perfectly all right. Voice Over At 8.30 the real training begins. Ken goes back to bed and his trainer gets him up. At 10.30 every morning Ken arrives at what he thinks is the gym. Sometimes it's a sweetshop, sometimes it's a private house. Today its a hospital. Doctor Urn, straight down there. Straight down there. Voice Over For lunch Ken crouches down in the road and rubs gravel into his hair. But lunch doesn't take long. Ken's soon up on his feet and back to bed. And his trainer has to run the 49,000 miles from his two-bedroom, six-living-room tree-house in Kyoto to wake him up. Trainer Hello. When Ken is in a really deep sleep like this one, the only way to wake him up is to saw his head off. Voice Over What is he like in the ring, this human dynamo, this eighteen-stone bantam weight battering-ram? We asked his sparring partner and one-time childhood sweetheart, Maureen Spencer. Maureen Well, I think that if Ken keeps his right up, gets in with the left jab and takes the fight to his man - well, he should go for a cut eye in the third and put Wilcox on the canvas by six. Voice Over Ken's opponent in Tuesday's fight is Petula Wilcox, the Birmingham girl who was a shorthand typist before turning pro in 1968. She's keen on knitting and likes Cliff Richard records. How does she rate her chances against Ken? Petula (Connie Booth) Well, I'm a southpaw and I think this will confuse him, particularly with his brain problem. Master of Ceremonies My lords, ladies and gedderbong... On my right, from the town of Reigate in the county of Kent, the heavyweight... Mr Ken Clean-Air Systems!... and on my left! Miss Petula Wilcox. Colonel Type I think boxing's a splendid sport - teaches you self-defense. Critic Obviously boxing must have its limits, but providing they're both perfectly fit I can see nothing wrong with one healthy man beating the living daylights out of a little schoolgirl. Voice It's quick and it's fun. Waitress Oh, no, he's gone. But he left a message. Jack! Where's that note that fellow left? Jack Oh, here you are. Waitress It says sorry, had to catch the last bus. Am on the 49b to Babbacombe. Linkman Oh, er, there you are. Hello. You got the note, jolly good. Well, um, that's all the items that we have for you this week and er, what a jolly nice lot of items too, eh? Um...well, the same team will be back with you again next week with another menu full of items. Um...I don't know if I shall be introducing the show next week as I understand my bits in this show have not been recieved quite as well as they might but er, never mind, the damage is done - no use in crying over spilt milk. I've had my chance and I've muffed it. Anyway, there we are. I'm not really awfully good with words. You see, I'm more of a visual performer. I have a very funny - though I say so myself - very funny funny walk. I wish I'd been in that show. I'd have done rather well. But anyway, there we are - the show's over. And...we'll all be - all be back with you again next week... Sorry. I do beg your pardon. I don't like these...displays of emotion...I wish it would say the end."}]}, {"description": "SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: '£3000'", "dialogue": [{"speaker": "Presenter", "text": "...to stop us from revealing your name, the name of the three other people involved, the youth organization to which they belong, and the shop where you bought the equipment."}, {"speaker": "Presenter", "text": "We'll be showing you more of that photograph later in the programme...unless we hear from Charles or Michael.

General Get me the Prime Minister. Not that quickly! Gentlemen, it's now quite apparent that the enemy are not only fighting this war on the cheap, but they're also not taking it seriously. Ageing General Bastards ... General First they drop cabbages instead of decent bombs ... Corporal The crates were probably quite expensive, sir. General Quiet, critic! And now they're doing very silly things in one of the most vital areas of the war! Ageing General What are we going to do, Shirley? General Well, we've got to act fast before it saps morale. We're going to show these Chinese ... Captain Germans, sir. General These Germans ... we're going to show them that no British soldier will descend to their level. Anyone found trivialising this war will face the supreme penalty that military law can provide. That was all right, I think? Captain Seemed to go quite well.

Walters Well, sir ... Presiding General Shut up! Colonel Fawcett for the prosecution ... Fawcett Sir, we all know ... Presiding General Shut up! Fawcett I'm sorry? Presiding General Carry on. Fawcett Sir, we all know the facts of this case; that Sapper Walters, being in possession of expensive military equipment, to wit one Lee Enfield .303 rifle and 72 rounds of ammunition, valued at a hundred and forty pounds three shillings and sixpence, chose instead to use wet towels to take an enemy command post in the area of Basingstoke ... Presiding General Basingstoke? Basingstoke in Hampshire? Fawcett No, no, no, sir, no. Presiding General I see, carry on. Fawcett The result of his action was that the enemy ... Presiding General Basingstoke ? Fawcett Basingstoke in Westphalia, sir. Presiding General Oh I see. Carry on. Fawcett The result of Sapper Walters's action was that the enemy received wet patches upon their trousers and in some cases small red strawberry marks upon their thighs ... Presiding General I didn't know there a Basingstoke in Westphalia. Fawcett It's on the map, sir. Presiding General What map? Fawcett The map of Westphalia as used by the army, sir. Presiding General Well, I've certainly never heard of Basingstoke in Westphalia. Fawcett It's a municipal borough sir, twenty-seven miles north-north east of Southhampton. Its chief manufactures ... Presiding General What ... Southhampton in Westphalia? Fawcett Yes sir ... bricks ... clothing. Nearby are remains of Basing House, burned down by Cromwell's cavalry in 1645 ... Presiding General Who compiled this map? Fawcett Cole Porter, sir. Presiding General Cole Porter ... who wrote `Kiss Me Kate'? Fawcett No, alas not, sir ... this was Cole Porter who wrote `Anything Goes'. Sir, I shall seek to prove that the man before this court ... Presiding General That's the same one! `In olden days a glimpse of stocking ...' Fawcett I your pardon, sir?

Anything goes in ... Presiding General No, that's not it ... carry on.

Presiding General Sixty-eight pounds ten shillings for a pair of ? Fawcett They were special gaiters, sir. Presiding General gaiters? Fawcett Yes, sir, they were made in France. One beret costing fourteen shillings, one pair of ... Presiding General What was special about them? Fawcett Oh ... they were made of a special fabric, sir. The buckles were made of empire silver instead of brass. The total value of the uniform was there ... Presiding General Why was the accused wearing special gaiters? Fawcett They were a presentation pair sir, from the regiment. The total value of the uniform ... Presiding General Why did they present him with a special pair of gaiters? Fawcett Sir, it seems to me totally irrelevant to the case whether the gaiters were presented to him or not, sir. Presiding General I think the court will be able to judge that for themselves. I want to know why the regiment presented the accused with a special pair of gaiters. Fawcett He ... used to do things for them. The total value ... Presiding General What things? Fawcett He .. he used to oblige them, sir. The total value ... Presiding General them? Fawcett Yes, sir. The total value of the uniform ... Presiding General How did he oblige them? Fawcett What sir? Presiding General How did he them? Fawcett He ... um ... used to make them happy in little ways, sir. The total value of the uniform could therefore not have been less than ... Presiding General Did he touch them at all? Fawcett Sir! I submit that this is totally irrelevant. Presiding General I want to know how he made them happy. Fawcett He used to ram things up their ... Presiding General All right! All right! No need to spell it out! What er ... what has the accused to say? Walters What, me? Presiding General Yes. What have you got to say? Walters What can say? I mean, how can I encapsulate in mere words my scorn for any military solution? The fultility of modern warfare? And the hypocrisy by which contemporary government applies one standard to violence within the community and another to violence perpetrated by one community upon another? Defense Counsel I'm sorry, but my client has become pretentious. I will say in his defense that he has suffered ... Fawcett Sir! We haven't finished the prosecution! Presiding General Shut up! I'm in charge of this court. Stand up! Sit down! Go moo! See? Right, now, on with the pixie hats! And order in the skating vicar. Everyone Anything goes in. Anything goes out! Fish, bananas, old pyjamas, Mutton! Beef! and Trout! Anything goes in. Anything goes out. SUPERIMPOSED CAPTIONS: 'DRAMA!' ' ACTION!' Voice Over Yes! Coming to this cinema soon!

It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong.

Tonight Ethell the Frog examinesthe rise to power of the Piranhas, the methods they used to subjugate rival gangs and their subsequent tracking down and capture by the brilliant Superintendent Harry 'Snapper' Organs of Q Division. Doug and Dinsdale Pirenha were born, on probation, in this small house in Kipling Road, Southwark, the eldest sons in a family of sixteen. Their father Arthur Piranha, a scrap-metal dealer and TV quizmaster, was well known to the police, and a devout Catholic. In January 1928 he had married Kitty Malone, an up-and-coming Eastend boxer.

In this racket they selected another victim and threatened to beat him up if he pay them. One month later they hit upon 'The Other Other Operation'.

You join us just as the competitors are running out onto the field on this lovely winter's afternoon here, with the going firm underfoot and very little sign of rain. Well it certainly looks as though we're in for a splendid afternoon's sport in this the 127th Upperclass Twit of the Year Show. Well the competitors will be off in a moment so let me just identify for you. Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith has an O-level in chemo-hygiene. Simon-Zinc-Trumpet-Harris, married to a very attractive table lamp. Nigel Incubator-Jones, his best friend is a tree, and in his spare time he's a stockbroker. Gervaise Brook-Hampster is in the Guards, and his father uses him as a wastepaper basket. And finally Oliver St John-Mollusc, Harrow and the Guards, thought by many to be this year's outstanding twit. Now they're moving up to the starting line, there's a jolly good crowd here today. Now they're under starter's orders ... and they're off! Ah no, they're not. No they didn't realize they were supposed to start. Never mind, we'll soon sort that out, the judge is explaining it to them now. I think Nigel and Gervaise have got the idea. All set to go. Oh, and they're off and it's a fast start this year. Oliver St John-Mollusc running a bit wide there and now they're coming into their first test, the straight line. They've got to walk along this straight line without failing over and Oliver's over at the back there, er, Simon's coming through quite fast on the outside, I think Simon and Nigel, both of them coming through very fast. There's Nigel there. No. Three, I'm sorry, and on the outside there's Gervaise coming through just out of shot and now, the position... Simon and Vivian at the front coming to the matchbox jump.. three layers of matchboxes to clear... and Simon's over and Vivian's over beautifully, oh and the jump of a lifetime - if only his father could understand. Here's Nigel ... and now Gervaise is over he's, er, Nigel is over, and it's Gervaise, Gervaise is going to jump it, is it, no he's jumped the wrong way, there he goes, Nigel's over, beautifully. Now it's only Oliver. Oliver ... and Gervaise... oh bad luck. And now it's Kicking the Beggar. Simon's there and he's putting the boot in, and not terribly hard, but he's going down and Simon can move on. Now Vivian's there. Vivian is there and waiting for a chance. Here he comes, oh a piledriver, a real piledriver, and now Simon's on No. l, Vivian 2, Nigel 3, Gervaise on 4 and Oliver bringing up the rear. Ah there's Oliver , there's Oliver now, he's at the back. I think he's having a little trouble with his old brain injury, he's going to have a go, no, no, bad luck, he's up, he doesn't know when he's beaten, this boy, he doesn't know when he's winning either. He doesn't have any sort of sensory apparatus. Oh there's Gervaise and he's putting the boot in there and he's got the beggar down and the steward's giving him a little bit of advice, yes, he can move on now, he can move on to the Hunt Photograph. He's off, Gervaise is there and Oliver's still at the back having trouble with the matchboxes. Now here's the Hunt Ball Photograph and the first here's Simon, he's going to enjoy a joke with Lady Arabella Plunkett. She hopes to go into films, and Vivian's through there and, er, Nigel's there enjoying a joke with Lady Sarah Pencil Farthing Vivian Streamroller Adams Pie Biscuit Aftershave Gore Stringbottom Smith. And there's, there's Simon now in the sports car, he's reversed into the old woman, he's caught her absolutely beautifully. Now he's going to accelerate forward there to wake up the neighbour. There's Vivian I think, no Vivian's lost his keys, no there's Vivian, he's got the old woman, slowly but surely right in the midriff, and here he is. Here he is to wake up the neighbour now. Simon right in the lead, comfortably in the lead, but he can't get this neighbour woken up. He's slamming away there as best he can. He's getting absolutely no reaction at all. There, he's woken him up and Simon's through. Here comes Vivian, Vivian to slam the door, and there we are back at the Hunt Ball, I think that's Gervaise there, that's Gervaise going through there, and here, here comes Oliver, brave Oliver. Is he going to make it to the table, no I don't think he is, yes he is, he did it, ohh. And the crowd are rising to him there,and there I can see, who is that there, yes that's Nigel, Nigel has woken the neighbour - my God this is exciting. Nigel's got very excited and he's going through and here comes Gervaise. Gervaise, oh no this is, er, out in the front there is Simon who is supposed to insult the waiter and he's forgotten. And Oliver has run himself over, what a great twit! And now here comes Vivian, Vivian to insult the waiter, and he is heaping abuse on him, and he is humiliating him, there and he's gone into the lead. Simon's not with him, no Vivian's in front of him at the bar. Simon's got to get under this bar and this is extremely difficult as it requires absolutely expert co-ordination between mind and body. No Vivian isn't there. Here we go again and Simon's fallen backwards. Here's Nigel, he's tripped, Nigel has tripped, and he's under and Simon fails again, er, here is Gervaise, and Simon is through by accident. Here's Gervaise to be the last one over, there we are, here's Nigel right at the head of the field, and now he's going to shoot the rabbit, and these rabbits have been tied to the ground, and they're going to be a bit frisky, and this is only a one-day event. And they're blazing away there. They're not getting quite the results that they might, Gervaise is in there trying to bash it to death with the butt of his rifle, and I think Nigel's in there with his bare hands, but they're not getting the results that they might, but it is a little bit misty today and they must be shooting from a range of at least one foot. But they've had a couple of hits there I think, yes, they've had a couple of hits, and the whole field is up again and here they are. They're coming up to the debs, Gervaise first, Vivian second, Simon third. And now they've got to take the bras off from the front, this is really difficult, this is really the most, the most difficult part of the entire competition, and they're having a bit of trouble in there I think, they're really trying now and the crowd is getting excited, and I think some of the twits are getting rather excited too. Vivian is there, Vivian is coming through, Simon's in second place, and, no there's Oliver, he's not necessarily out of it. There goes Nigel, no he's lost something, and Gervaise running through to this final obstacle. Now all they have to do here to win the title is to shoot themselves. Simon has a shot. Bad luck, he misses. Nigel misses. Now there's Gervaise, and Gervaise has shot himself - Gervaise is Upperclass Twit of the Year. There's Nigel, he's shot Simon by mistake, Simon is back up and there's Nigel, Nigel's shot himself: Nigel is third in this fine and most exciting Upperclass Twit of the Year Show I've ever seen. Nigel's clubbed himself into fourth place. And so the final result: The Upperclass Twit of the Year - Gervaise Brook-Hampster of Kensington and Weybridge; runner up - Vivian Smith-Smythe-Smith of Kensington; and third - Nigel Incubator-Jones of Henley. Well there'll certainly be some car door slamming in the streets of Kensington tonight."}, {"speaker": "Voice Over", "text": "Dear Sir, how splendid it is to see the flower of British manhood wiping itself out with such pluck and tenacity.

Inside the house a stockbroker (Michael) is finishing his breakfast. His attractive wife looks on. He picks up his hat, rises, kisses her goodbye, and leaves. As he does so, she takes off her wrap and two men dressed only in briefs (Graham and Terry J) step out of the kitchen cupboard. In the front garden the stockbroker bids his neighbour (Graham) good morning; as he moves off a large African native throws an assegai, killing the neighbour. The stockbroker, not noticing this, moves on. A high street: he walks into a newsagents. Behind the counter a naked young lady gives him his newspaper. Taking his change without apparently noticing her he leaves. A bus queue: the stockbroker is at the head of it; there are four people behind him. As they wait, the Frankenstein monster comes up behind them and works his way along the queue, killing each member as he goes. He has just reached the stockbroker - who has not seen him - when the bus arrives and the stockbroker gets on. On the bus: all the other passengers are uniformed soldiers. The bus drives along a road past explosions and gunfire. A hand grenade comes through the window and lands on the seat next to the stockbroker. The soldiers leave the bus rapidly; the stockbroker calmly leaves the bus and walks down the street, in which the soldiers are engaged in a pitched battle. The stockbroker hails a taxi; it stops. No driver is visible. The stockbroker gets in and it drives off. In the stockbroker's office: a secretary is dead across her typewriter with a knife in her back; at the back of the office a pair of legs swing gently from the ceiling; a couple are snogging at his desk. Unconcerned, the stockbroker sits down. Furtively he looks round, then takes from the desk drawer a comic-book entitled 'Thrills and Adventure'. We see the frames of the comic strip. A Superman-type character and a girl are shrinking from an explosion. She is saying 'My God, his nose just exploded with enough force to destroy his kleenex'. In the next frame, the Superman character is saying 'If only I had a kleenex to lend him - or even a linen handkerchief - but these trousers...!! No back pocket!' In the frame beneath, he flies from side to side attempting to escape; finally he breaks through, bringing the two frames above down on himself. Cut to a picture of a safety curtain. An animated man come in front of it and says:", "The front stalls of a theatre. It is a first night - a lot of people in dinner jackets etc. About three rows back there is a spare seat. A general rustle of programmes, chocolates and theatrical murmurs. Suddenly a Sioux Indian enters, clad only in loin cloth, wearing war paint and with a single strip of hair in the middle of his head and feather. He carries a bow and a quiver of arrows.

The wedding takes place; just as it finishes the first Scotsman rides up to the kirk and rushes in.

He puts his towel on a breakwater next to another towel and starts to change. He suddenly looks up and we see everyone on the beach has turned to watch him - not with any disapproval - just a blank English stare. He grabs his towel off the breakwater and starts to take his trousers off under that. Girl in a bikini has been sitting on other side of the breakwater, stands up looking for her towel. She sees that the man is using it and she whisks it off him leaving him clutching his half-down trousers. Shot of everyone staring at him again. He pulls them up and makes for a beach hut... embarrassed. He goes into beach hut. Inside he is about to take his trousers off, when he becomes aware of a pair of feet which come up to the back of the beach hut - there is a 6-inch gap along bottom - and stop as if someone was peering through the crack. The man looks slightly outraged and pulls his trousers up, goes outside and edges cautiously round to the back of the beach hut. There he finds a man (Michael) bending close to the side of the beach hut with his hand to his face. The Gentleman kicks him hard in the seat of the pants. The man turns in obvious surprise, to reveal he was merely trying to light his cigarette out of the wind. The gentleman backs away with embarrassed apologies. We cut to the front of the beach hut to see gentleman backing round at the same time as a large matronly woman marches into the hut... the man follows her in. He is promptly thrown out on his ear. In desperation he looks around. On the promenade he suddenly sees an ice-cream van. He walks up to it, looks around, then nips behind to start changing. At the same time a policeman (Graham) strolls up to the ice-cream van and tells it to move on. The van drives off, exposing the gentleman clutching his trousers around his ankles. Close-up policeman's reaction. The man hurriedly pulls trousers up as policeman approaches him pulling out note book. Still covered in confusion he runs away from the policeman. In long shot we see him approach the commissionaire of the Royale Palace De Luxe Hotel. He whispers to the commissionaire, indicates by mime that he wants to take his trousers off. The commissionaire reacts to the gesture. The man nods. The commissionaire starts to take his trousers off. Man backs away once more in confusion - he has been misunderstood. Back on the beach again. He hides behind a pile of deckchairs. At that moment a beach party of jolly trippers arrive and each takes one. The deckchair pile rapidly disappears leaving the gentleman once again exposed. He dashes behind the deckchair attendant's hut which is next to him. Enter two workmen who dismantle it. Desperate by now he goes onto the pier. He goes into the amusement arcade, looking around furtively. Nips behind a 'what the butler saw' machine. Woman comes and puts penny in and starts to look, beckons over husband; he comes, looks in the machine, sees the man changing his trousers. They chase him off. Still pursued he nips into door. Finds himself in blackness. Relieved - at last he has found somewhere to change. He relaxes and starts to take his trousers off.
